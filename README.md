# OPL-Casino-Lisp

This is the second project in my Organization of Programming Languages class and it is to make the game of Casino in the programming language Lisp. I have already made the game before in C++ but now this project is to try and learn how to create the same game using functional programming.

***** This is a work in progress. *****
